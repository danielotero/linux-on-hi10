### Introduction
This is my attempt to gather all the information in one place on how to support the [Chuwi Hi10 Pro](http://en.chuwi.com/product/items/Chuwi-Hi10-Pro.html) tablet on Linux.

The configuration will be around my distribution ([Arch Linux](https://www.archlinux.org/)), but I hope that all the instructions here can be easily adapted to other distributions. Be aware that Arch Linux it's a [rolling realese](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rolling_release) distribution, so all software used will be pretty recent.

### Basic specifications
